        Vision Network Solutions, Inc. has provided services to our company since 2005. I have always found Jan, Brian and their staff to be extremely conscientious and all services provided to be of the highest caliber. The entire Vision staff is well-trained, highly professional and most cooperative.
        <br/><br/>
        Jan Erickson provides outstanding service and is extremely committed. He has worked on numerous projects for JMS Companies; all were highly successful! One major project was the company relocation to a new office. Jan’s quality of work was outstanding, his work ethic, determination, genuine character and dedication in completing the job, enabled us to stay on schedule and be fully operational day one at the new office.
        <br/><br/>
        I have the utmost respect for Jan and Vision Network Solutions, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Vision Network Solutions to my friends and colleagues.

      person: Jerry Sazama
      text: Staffing Partners has relied on Jan Erickson from Vision Network Solutions since 2002. I receive sales calls on a daily basis with regard to various IT Solutions being offered and I simply let them know that our needs have always been handled beyond expectations, day or night, by our current provider. Many firms offer competitive rates, service plans and solutions galore but I can’t imagine receiving better service or more technical expertise than what we achieve by working with Jan at Vision Network Solutions.
